# Pantry-App

I made this app since I wanted to reduce food waste personally and promote cooking for myself.
This app proves that whether you have a little or a lot in your pantry, you can always manage to cook something.

Using the Pantry web app, users can track their grocery items in a virtual pantry. 
Pantry is divided into pantry items, ingredients, and recipes. Users can post pantry items and their names, images,
descriptions, food types, amounts, and expiration dates. From the pantry, users can pick out ingredients and Pantry will
analyze those ingredients and get recipes that can be made from said ingredients.
